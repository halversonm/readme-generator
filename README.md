# Professional README Generator

## Description
    
Save yourself time by using this application to generate a professional README for your projects! By making this application I was able to practice working with node.js and npm. 
    
## Installation
    
To install this project you must clone the code from the index.js file in this repository. You must also have node.js and the inquirer package installed in order to use the application.
    
## Usage
    
Once you have all of the above things installed, to use the README generator all you need to do is enter 'node index.js' in your terminal (make sure you are in the README generator's working directory). Then a series of prompts will ask you about the project. After answering these questions, the generator will create a profesionally formatted README.md file with all of your answers included. A short video showing how to use the README generator has been included.
